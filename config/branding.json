		{
			"question": "How did you learn to code?",
			"answer": "I'm a self taught developer, which means I learnt everything I know by being curious and reading docs. I started with Python, HTML and CSS and then moved on to JavaScript.\n\nAfter that, I went on to use PHP + MySQL, which led me to Laravel: I then learnt how to use React + Firebase, which led me to Next.js. In the process, I learnt how to use Git, and how to use JQuery. I also got sick of Bootstrap along the way and found out about TailwindCSS, which I use on everything nowadays"
		},
		{
			"question": "What's your favorite language + framework combination?",
			"answer": "Definitely Next.js + TailwindCSS + Firebase, plus Node for backends."
		},
		{
			"question": "What's your favorite IDE?",
			"answer": "Visual Studio Code is by far the best IDE I have used. It supports every language and framework thanks to extensions, and it has a great UI."
		},
		{
			"question": "What do you do for a living?",
			"answer": "I'm currently a student coding as a side hobby, and learning new things along the way!"
		},
		{
			"question": "What advice would you give to new developers?",
			"answer": "Definitely give Firebase a shot, and try to learn as much as you can. Being able to use GitHub's CI/CD pipeline efficiently is a skill that I think every developer should have: and remember, when you have an issue, the community is always here to help."
		},
		{
			"question": "What's your favorite way to learn?",
			"answer": "I like to learn by doing, so basically thinking of a project and reading docs or guides until I figure it out."
